# local-storage-in-html5
 HTML5 that allows web applications to store data locally within a user's browser.
 The two most common forms of web storage are LocalStorage and Session Storage. The key difference between these two forms of web storage is that data saved in LocalStorage never leaves the browser and remains there until you explicitly remove it. In contrast, data stored in Session Storage is removed once a browser tab/window is closed.
